* The icon for my website was created to give the website a cosy feel whilst keeping it simple.
* The background of the icon matches similarly to the main colour of the website.

### Navigation:

* The navigation bar is located at the top of the page and will remain at the top of the page even when scrolling through the website.
* It has the company name centered in the navigation bar followed by page links to other areas in the website. 
* The first three links will remain on the same HTML page however the fourth link will take you to an external html page specifially designed for the gallery.
* The nav bar also changes when going to the gallery link as it no longer needs the four links.

### Outdoor Yoga

* I created this section as a small incite into what we can offer, and that it's out of the ordinary. It makes it stand out against other competitors.
* I have also included a large image showcasing what it looks like and how many people join in. The aim of this is to prevent the thought of being the only one there.
