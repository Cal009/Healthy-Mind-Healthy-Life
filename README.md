* The navigation bar is located at the top of the page and will remain at the top of the page even when scrolling through the website.

* The first three links will remain on the same HTML page however the fourth link will take you to an external html page specifially designed for the gallery.
* The nav bar also changes when going to the gallery link as it no longer needs the four links.

### Outdoor Yoga:

* I created this section as a small insight into what we can offer, and that it's out of the ordinary. It makes it stand out against other competitors.
* I have also included a large image showcasing what it looks like and how many people join in. The aim of this is to prevent the thought of being the only one there.
