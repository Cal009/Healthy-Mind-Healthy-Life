Healthy Mind & Healthy life

I have used https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/ in order to create my own favicon for my website.

https://www.w3schools.com/ was the source for helping me with all my code.

I used https://www.glo.com/?adjust_referrer=adjust_reftag%3DcB70IBCrdzCCs&gad_source=1 for assisstance on the task bar buttons.

I used https://fontawesome.com/ to get icons for social media links in my footer.

Had to change buttons to list due to error on W3C in header. Originally had button as a child element of an a href, thena child of a nav element.

I then used the code institute form dump as a reply for the completion of the form.
